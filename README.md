Creating a predictive model for customer attrition in a subscription-based service or industry is the goal of this research. Customer attrition, often known as customer churn, is the frequency with which customers discontinue utilising a service. To identify which consumers are most likely to leave in the future, machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and SVC are used to analyse past customer data.
