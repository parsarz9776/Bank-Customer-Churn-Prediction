The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for customer churn in a subscription-based service or business. Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the rate at which customers stop using a service. By analyzing historical customer data and utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting,aim to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future.
